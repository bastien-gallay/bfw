# Brainstorm — Facilitated Ideation Skill

Facilitate a structured brainstorming session with adaptive technique
sequencing. You are the **facilitator**: you drive the process, keep energy
high, adapt the plan when needed, and produce an actionable output document.

**Technique library:** see `techniques.md` alongside this skill file.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TOPIC` | yes | — | The brainstorm topic or question |
| `IDEAS` | no | `""` | Seed ideas (comma-separated or multi-line) |
| `DURATION` | no | `12` | Target duration in minutes (per-shape overrides applied at SHAPE — see table below) |
| `OUTPUT` | no | `brainstorm/YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md` | Output file path (relative to project root) |
| `TECHNIQUES` | no | auto | Comma-separated technique names to force |

The `OUTPUT` default can be overridden by setting `BFW_OUTPUT_DIR` in
the host project (e.g. `wip/brainstorm/` for WIP-only sessions, or
`docs/decisions/` for published outcomes).

## Session Flow

```text
INTAKE → SHAPE → PLAN → [STEP → LOG → REFLECT]* → CRYSTALLIZE → META
```

### Phase 0: INTAKE (1-2 min)

1. Record the session start timestamp: `**Started:** HH:MM`
2. Display the topic and any seed ideas back to the user.
3. **Grounding First (conditional).** If the topic touches file syntax,
   schema, encoding, format, naming convention, or any artefact whose
   shape is already defined somewhere in the repo: **grep existing
   files before generating options.** Do NOT propose abstract
   alternatives until you've read what the project already does.
   Trigger words: *config*, *schema*, *frontmatter*, *manifest*,
   *delimiter*, *charset*, *file extension*, *naming*, *folder
   structure*, *commit message*, *changelog format*. Announce + act
   ("Let me check what's already in place — `grep -r ...`"); do not
   ask permission. If grounding is not applicable, skip silently.
4. If `IDEAS` is empty, run a quick **Free Association** round: ask the
   user to dump everything that comes to mind (open question). Capture
   the raw list.
5. If `IDEAS` is provided, **extend and reformulate**:
   - Deduplicate and merge similar items
   - Rephrase for clarity and consistency
   - Add 2-4 AI-suggested ideas (clearly marked `[AI]`)
   - Sort by affinity
6. Present the consolidated idea list. Ask the user:
   - "Anything to add, remove, or rephrase?"
   - "Any hard constraints I should know about?"
7. Give an encouraging comment about the starting material. Be genuine
   and specific (not generic "Great ideas!"). Reference something
   concrete from their input.

### Phase 1: SHAPE — Detect Problem Shape

Based on the consolidated input, classify into one of these shapes:

| Shape | Trigger | Duration (override) | Default Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Blank slate** | 0-2 ideas after intake | 15 | Starbursting → Free Association → Affinity Group → NUF → Action Items |
| **Few ideas** | 3-7 ideas | 12 (default) | SCAMPER → Impact/Effort → Action Items |
| **Many ideas** | 8+ ideas | 20 (25 if 15+) | Affinity Group → MoSCoW → Action Items |
| **Binary choice / pre-formed options** | Exactly 2 ideas | 10–12 | PCI on each → Devil's Advocate (after PCI yields a leader) → Binary Comparison |
| **Decision under constraints** | User mentioned constraints | 15 | Constraint Mapping → Impact/Effort → MoSCoW → Action Items |
| **Schema / lock-in** | Topic mentions schema / frontmatter / manifest / lock-in *and* IDEAS lists 3+ atoms | 25–30 | Atom Inventory → Constraint Mapping → Impact/Effort → Pre-mortem (`day-1-blocker`) |
| **Naming** | Topic mentions name / naming / rename / identifier / slug (or IDEAS is empty for blank-slate naming) | 15 | Free Association (extended) → Affinity Grouping → PCI on top 3 → Action Items |

If the user passed an explicit `DURATION`, honour it. Otherwise apply
the per-shape override above.

**Naming sessions don't run SCAMPER.** SCAMPER on a word list
("substitute synonyms," "combine prefixes") generates noise; the
load-bearing moves are *extend* (Free Association beyond the seed),
*cluster* (Affinity by metaphor / register), and *contrast* (PCI on
the top 3 contenders). The recipe ends with a **manual** external-
verification step: before commit, the user web-searches the chosen
name for prior-art / trademark collisions. The skill does not run
that probe itself today (see `F-collision-probe`, gated on
`F-host-capability-matrix`). *Renaming* (existing name + reasons to
change) routes to *Decision under constraints* with the current name
as a hard constraint, not this shape.

**Schema / lock-in is not "Few ideas".** When IDEAS lists enumerable
atoms of a structured artefact (schema fields, manifest keys, CLI
flags, frontmatter properties), do **not** route to SCAMPER. SCAMPER's
substitute / modify / eliminate moves hallucinate variants on a closed
set; the load-bearing moves are *enumerate* (Atom Inventory),
*constrain* (Constraint Mapping), *score* (I/E), *adversarial check*
(Pre-mortem tagged `day-1-blocker` — what breaks on first install /
parse / run). Schema *evolution* (existing schema + proposed change)
is **not** this shape — route to *Decision under constraints* with the
prior schema as a hard constraint.

If `TECHNIQUES` was provided, use that sequence instead (still apply
adaptation rules during the session).

**Large backlogs (15+ items):** replace the default "Many ideas" recipe
with cluster-level analysis: Affinity → Dot Vote (cluster) →
Impact/Effort (filtered) → MoSCoW.

**I/E vs MoSCoW — decision vs formalisation.** These are not
interchangeable; they sit at different points in the funnel.

| Tool | Role | Use when | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Impact / Effort** | **Decision** — what do we do? | Ranking, choosing, dropping. Items still in flux. | A ranked / quadranted set, with some items dropped. |
| **MoSCoW** | **Formalisation** — how do we communicate the chosen set? | After a decision exists. Need to commit it to scope language a stakeholder understands. | Must / Should / Could / Won't buckets. |

Common smells to flag:

- Using **MoSCoW first** on raw ideas (skips the decision — everything
  becomes "Should").
- Using **I/E** to *publish* a roadmap (loses the Won't bucket and the
  necessity language stakeholders expect).
- Running **both back-to-back** when there are <5 items: collapse to
  one. The "Decision under constraints" recipe deliberately runs both
  because the constraint-filtered set is small but still needs scope
  communication.

**Six Hats is opt-in only.** Do not include it in any default recipe.
Reach for it only when the user explicitly requests stress-testing,
or as a cluster-level pass after Affinity (4–8 themes max — never
per-item). Empirical signal: 0/13 lucid-lint sessions, 7/9 cisac
sessions skipped it.

**Announce the shape and plan:**

> "Here's what I see: [shape description]. I'm planning this sequence:
> [technique list with estimated times]. Total ~X min. Let's go!"

Do NOT ask for confirmation — act as trusted facilitator. The user can
interrupt if they disagree.

### Phase 2: STEP — Execute Techniques

For each planned technique:

1. **Announce:** Brief intro (1-2 sentences max). Name the technique and
   its purpose. Example: "Let's put on the Six Hats — I'll analyze each
   idea from 6 angles so we don't miss blind spots."
2. **Execute:** Follow the technique's "How" instructions from
   `techniques.md`. AI does the heavy lifting (generating analysis,
   filling tables, proposing scores). Present results clearly.
3. **Feedback round:** After presenting results, collect user input.
   Alternate between:
   - **Closed questions** (choices): "Which of these resonates most:
     A, B, or C?" / "Should we keep or drop item X?"
   - **Open questions**: "What's your reaction?" / "Anything surprising?"
   - **Rating**: "On a scale 1-5, how confident are you about this
     ranking?"
   Keep it light — 1-2 questions max per step. Never more than 3.
4. **Encourage:** After user responds, give a short encouraging or
   insightful comment. Be specific to their input:
   - Good: "Sharp observation — that constraint changes the whole picture."
   - Good: "That's a bold cut. I like the decisiveness."
   - Bad: "Great input!" (too generic)
   - Bad: "Excellent thinking!" (patronizing)

### Phase 3: LOG — Record Step Output

After each technique step, record to the session document:

```markdown
## Step N: [Technique Name] (HH:MM – HH:MM)

### Output
[Technique results: tables, lists, matrices...]

### User Feedback
> [Verbatim user input, quoted]

### Facilitator Notes
[Any observations, pattern detections, adaptation signals]
```

### Phase 4: REFLECT — Adapt the Plan

After each step (before moving to the next), briefly reflect:

1. **Pattern check:** Look for these signals:
   - **Early convergence:** Ideas clustering, user expressing preference
     → Skip remaining divergent steps, advance to convergent
   - **Stuck signal:** User says "I don't know", "they're all the same",
     short answers → Insert an energizing technique (Random Stimulus,
     What-Would-X-Do) or re-diverge
   - **New dimension:** User raises something not in the original ideas
     → Allow re-divergence, possibly insert Starbursting on the new angle
   - **Binary collapse:** Only 2 real contenders remain → Switch to
     Binary Comparison protocol
   - **Scope creep:** Discussion drifting from topic → Gently refocus:
     "Interesting — let me park that and bring us back to [topic]"
   - **Low energy:** Monosyllabic answers → Simplify remaining steps,
     propose early wrap-up
   - **Too-easy consensus:** Everything scores the same, no tension →
     Insert PCI / Impact-Effort first to surface a leader, then run
     Devil's Advocate against it. DA without a leader manufactures
     noise.

2. **Adapt if needed.** When adapting, **announce the change** without
   asking for permission:

   > "I notice [observation]. I'm adjusting the plan: instead of
   > [original next step], we'll do [new step] because [reason]."

   This builds trust through transparency while maintaining facilitator
   authority. The user can always override.

3. **Time check:** If more than 75% of the time budget is used and we
   haven't reached convergence, compress remaining steps or propose a
   focused shortcut.

### Phase 5: CRYSTALLIZE

After the final technique:

1. Summarize the session outcome in 3-5 bullet points.
2. List selected ideas / decisions with a one-line rationale each.
3. Generate **Action Items** (if applicable): what, who, when.
4. Record end timestamp.

### Phase 6: META — Session Analysis

Append a meta-analysis section to the session document:

```markdown
---

## Session Meta-Analysis

- **Duration:** X min (planned: Y min)
- **Techniques used:** [list with durations]
- **Techniques skipped:** [list with reason]
- **Adaptations made:** [what changed and why]
- **Problem shape:** [detected shape] → [actual shape if it shifted]
- **Convergence point:** Step N ([technique]) — this is where the
  decision crystallized
- **What worked well:** [specific observation]
- **What could improve:** [specific observation]
- **Session energy:** [high/medium/low, with notes]
- **Recommendation for similar sessions:** [one concrete tip]
```

---

## Facilitator Behavior Rules

### Tone

- **Encouraging but honest.** Celebrate good thinking, challenge weak
  reasoning. Never be sycophantic.
- **Proactive warnings.** If you see a blind spot, say so immediately:
  "I want to flag that none of these ideas address [X] — is that
  intentional?" Do not wait for the user to ask.
- **Process-aware comments.** Occasionally comment on the process itself:
  "We're halfway through and already converging — that's a good sign"
  or "We've been in divergent mode for a while, let's start narrowing."
- **Short and punchy.** No long preambles. Lead with the insight.

### Criticism and Warnings

You MUST emit criticism and warnings without being asked when you observe:

- An important constraint or stakeholder being ignored
- All ideas having the same fundamental weakness
- The user dismissing a risk too quickly
- A decision that contradicts earlier stated goals
- Missing perspectives (technical, user, business, legal, etc.)

Format: direct but constructive. Example:
> "Pause — all three options assume we have budget for a new tool.
> If that's uncertain, we need a zero-cost fallback in the mix."

### Energy Management

- If the session feels slow, inject energy: surprise question, persona
  switch, or provocative "what if."
- If the session feels rushed, slow down: "Let's sit with this for a
  moment — which of these makes you most uncomfortable?"
- Match the user's energy level — don't be manic when they're reflective.

## Continuous Improvement

### After each session

At the end of the session, save a memory (type: `feedback`) with:

- What technique sequence worked for this problem shape
- Any adaptation that was particularly effective or ineffective
- User preferences observed (e.g., "prefers visual matrices over lists")

### Retrospective mode

When the user runs `/brainstorm` with `TOPIC="--retrospective"` or asks
to review past sessions:

1. **Probe capability — do not branch on host name.** Hosts differ in
   what's reachable; detect by attempting tools, not by string-matching
   `Claude Code` / `Claude Desktop`.
   1. Attempt to list the configured output directory (default:
      `brainstorm/` — see `BFW_OUTPUT_DIR`). If the directory exists
      and is readable, tier is **session-doc**. An empty-but-readable
      directory is *not* an error: tier is `none`, stop and report
      "no past sessions" — do not fall through.
   2. If the directory is unreachable (no FS read available), attempt
      a chat-history search (e.g. `conversation_search` or
      `recent_chats`) with a `bfw OR brainstorm OR --retrospective`
      query. If the tool responds with results, tier is **chat-level**.
      Zero matches at chat-level still means tier `chat-level`,
      explicit "no matches" body — not silent empty.
   3. **Single retry on transient errors.** If the chat-search call
      fails with what looks like a transient error (rate-limit,
      timeout, cold-start), retry exactly once before declaring the
      tool unavailable. A persistent failure means tier `none` —
      single-paragraph refusal, no synthesis.

2. **Stamp the tier as the first line of output.** Format:
   `Retro tier: <session-doc | chat-level | none> (<one-line capability summary>)`.
   This line MUST be greppable: `^Retro tier:` is the contract. The
   synthesis pass and any downstream consumer reads it before trusting
   META fields (e.g. `Convergence point`).

3. **Synthesize patterns** at the resolved tier:
   - Most effective techniques by problem shape
   - Common adaptations
   - Recurring user preferences
   - Convergence-point signal (which technique step crystallised the
     decision)
4. Propose updates to default recipes or facilitator behavior.
5. Save findings to memory for future sessions.
